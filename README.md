# Gait event
Automated gait event detection for Parkinson's Disease patients with freezing of gait. From our paper:
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gaitpost.2020.05.026

## Info
1. Read script to extract the lower limb kinematics from a directory containing c3d files and write them to csv.
2. Training script (see paper for more info about the procedure)
3. Labelling script to import a pre-trained model and annotate gait events directly in the c3d file.
